	@description =  Our technology has come to the point where size doesn't matter anymore. Well, at least after separation from its fairing. The PA550 offers more living space than any other space habitat on the market.

	@description = After a literal breakthrough in inflatable habitat module design (it was very messy and the investigation is still ongoing), the PA250 Habitat was scrapped and replaced by the PA330, a vast improvement in all areas. It features 30 cubic meters of living space arranged in three stories around a central core, enough to reasonably house up to four kerbals for extended periods of time.
