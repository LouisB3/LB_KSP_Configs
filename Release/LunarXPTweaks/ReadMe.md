## Lunar XP Tweaks

Astronaut XP progression in stock KSP is unsatisfying: planting a flag on the Mun doesn't even get a kerbal to Level 2; it's impossible to get to Level 3 within the Kerbin system.

This changes several bodies' XP multipliers to place greater emphasis on flags-and-footprints missions to the Mun, Minmus, and Duna. A flag on either of Kerbin's moons are sufficient to reach Level 2; flags on both will grant Level 3; and a subsequent flag on Duna will provide Level 4.

As a side effect, lunar contracts will have somewhat greater rewards (and contracts in solar orbit will have lesser rewards.) This is because KSP uses the same variable ("recoveryValue") to tune both astronaut XP and contract values. Since stock career mode balance is a mess anyway, this behavior is deemed an acceptable trade-off.
